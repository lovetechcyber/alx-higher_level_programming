As I am diving deeper in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with python, this project introduce me to the concept of inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.
